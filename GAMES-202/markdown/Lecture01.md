# GAMES202 Lecture 01 - Introduction and Overview

## I. Overview

### What is GAMES202 about?

- A course at **intermediate level**: connecting basic knowledge and research
- **Real-Time** High Quality Rendering
  - **Speed**: More than *30 FPS*, for VR/AR *90 FPS* or above
  - **Interactivity**: Each frame generated on the fly
- Real-Time **High Quality** Rendering
  - **Realism**: Advanced approaches to make rendering more realistic
  - **Dependability**: All-time *correctness (exact or approximate)*, no tolerance to (uncontrollable) failures
- Real-Time High Quality **Rendering**
  - What is rendering? Calculating light which human eyes perceive
    - 3D Scene -> Image



#### Course Topics

**4 Different Parts on Real-Time Rendering**:

- Shadow and Environment Mapping
- Interactive Global Illumination Techniques
- Physically Based Shading
- Real-Time Ray Tracing



**Topics**:

- Shadow and Environment Mapping
- Interactive Global Illumination Techniques
- Precomputed Radiance Transfer
- Real-Time Ray Tracing
- Participating Media Rendering, Image Space Effects, etc.
- Non-Photorealistic Rendering
- Antialiasing and Supersampling
- *Chatting about tech and games*



### What is GAMES202 NOT about?

Overall, not about a specific engine or API, and not about offline rendering.

- 3D modeling or game development, or specific API
- Expensive light transport techniques
- Neural Rendering (*Why?*)
- Specific optimization and high performance computing



### How to study GAMES202?

- Real-time rendering: *fast & approximate offline rendering + systematic engineering*.
- Fact: in real-time rendering technologies, the industry is *way ahead of the academia*.
- Practice makes perfect.
