# GAMES202 - Notes

## Introduction to This Course

GAMES202 (2021-03), or **Real-Time High Quality Rendering**, is an open course in computer graphics conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan. The course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental problems appeared in the field of real-time rendering and their corresponding solutions. 

As real-time rendering demands high speed (>30 FPS), the course focuses on breaking the trade-off between speed and quality within stringent time constraints, while ensuring both **real-time high speed** and **photorealism**. A number of cutting-edge topics in academia and industry will be covered, including:

- Soft Shadow Rendering, 
- Environmental Lighting, 
- Global Illumination Techniques (both precomputation-based and without precomputation), 
  - Interactive Global Illumination, ...
- Physically-Based Shading Models and Methods, 
- Real-time Ray Tracing, 
- Anti-Aliasing, 
- Supersampling, and 
- Common Techniques for Acceleration.

The purpose of this repository is to track personal progress.

## About Notes and Copyright

### How do I read notes online?

So far GitHub markdown preview cannot provide satisfying experience on physical formulae. We compiled these notes into HTML format for easy access.

Online reading experience currently relies on the HTML preview service provided by GitHub. Below are some temporary links that you may use to access notes.

Only when the entire note has been completed will the readable-html be available.

Select a html file from here and preview it in [HTML Preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io).

### Online Notes (Based on HTML Preview)

*Currently there is none.*

### How do I read notes using local tools?

The recommended reader is Typora, which is a commercial software (and has a not-that-good reputation in the open source community). 

However, it comes with rich support in inline math and exporting markdown to HTML. The HTML files you see in this folder are exported by Typora.
