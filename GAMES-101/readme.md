# GAMES101 - Notes

## Introduction to This Course

GAMES101 (2020-02), or **Introduction to Computer Graphics**, conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan, is an introductory course that explores the fundamentals of Computer Graphics. This comprehensive offering provides students with a solid foundation in essential principles and techniques used in CG, including rendering (both rasterization and modern ray-tracing), geometry, and animation. Additionally, the course showcases the captivating nature of the field and highlights cutting-edge research conducted by leading experts. Students are expected to gain a deeper understanding of visually stunning virtual environments and stay informed about the latest advancements in CG.

## About This Repository

This repository contains my notes for GAMES101 conducted by Prof. Lingqi Yan. 

The purpose of this repository is to track personal progress.

According to the policy listed in the slide of the first week, this public repository is uploaded only for educational/referential usages and discussions.

It is VIOLATING THE POLICY specified in GAMES101 to directly copy these referential materials and use as a student's own solution without having them walked through by itself first. 

## About Notes and Copyright

### How do I read notes online?

So far GitHub markdown preview cannot provide satisfying experience on physical formulae. We compiled these notes into HTML format for easy access.

Online reading experience currently relies on the GitHub Pages service. Below you will find the links to them.

### How do I read notes using local tools?

The recommended reader is Typora, which is a commercial software (and has a not-that-good reputation in the open source community). 

However, it comes with rich support in inline math and exporting markdown to HTML. The HTML files you see in this folder are exported by Typora.
