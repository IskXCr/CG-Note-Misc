## I. Overview

### What's GAMES101 about?

- **Rasterization**
  
  Gold standard in Video Games (Real-time Applications)
  
  - Project **geometry primitives** (3D triangles/polygons) onto the screen
  - Break projected primitives into **fragments** (pixels)

- **Curves and Meshes**
  
  - How to represent geometry in Computer Graphics?
  
- **Ray Tracing**
  
  Gold standard in **animations/movies** (offline applications)

  - Shoot rays from the camera through each pixel
    - Calculate **intersection** and **shading**
  
    - **Continue to bounce** the rays till they hit light sources
  
- **Animation/Simulation**
  
  - Key frame animation
  - Mass-spring system



### What's GAMES101 NOT about?

In general, usage of **specific APIs** and **tools**.

- *Principles only!*
