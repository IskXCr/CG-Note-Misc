## I. 2D Transformations

- **Rotation**
- **Shear**
- **Scale**

*You must already be familiar with linear algebra! If not, view the lecture slides as it is clearer on them.*

## II. Homogeneous Coordinates

Designed to solve the problem in *translation*.

- Represent **any linear operation** into a linear transformation, which can be then represented by matrices.
  - *Curvilinear-related operations still cannot be done directly! Such as simulating rays passing through a lens. However, there are other ways, of course.*
